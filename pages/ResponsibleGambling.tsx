            <li><span className="text-brand-text"><strong>Bet for Fun, Not as Income:</strong> Treat gambling as a form of entertainment, not a way to make money.</span></li>
            <li><span className="text-brand-text"><strong>Only Bet What You Can Afford:</strong> Never bet more than you are willing to lose. Use a dedicated entertainment budget.</span></li>
            <li><span className="text-brand-text"><strong>Set Limits:</strong> Before you start, decide on a time limit and a money limit and stick to them.</span></li>
            <li><span className="text-brand-text"><strong>Don't Chase Losses:</strong> Accepting losses is part of the game. Trying to win back lost money can lead to bigger losses.</span></li>
            <li><span className="text-brand-text"><strong>Know When to Stop:</strong> Understand the signs of problem gambling. If it's no longer fun, it's time to take a break.</span></li>
